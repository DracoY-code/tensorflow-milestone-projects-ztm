# Milestone Projects from the ZTM TensorFlow Bootcamp
All of the milestone projects for the [Zero To Mastery TensorFlow Developer Certificate Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/) on Udemy.

## MP1: Food Vision üçï
The aim of this project is to classify images of food (101 classes) from the [Food-101 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The research paper(s) referenced:
- [Bossard, L., Guillaumin, M., Van Gool, L. (2014). Food-101 ‚Äì Mining Discriminative Components with Random Forests.](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/)

## MP2: SkimLit üìù
The aim of this project is to utilise Natural Language Processing concepts and classify sentences from the [PubMed 200k RCT dataset](https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct) into one of the following classes: `BACKGROUND`, `OBJECTIVE`, `METHOD`, `RESULT`, or `CONCLUSION` using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
